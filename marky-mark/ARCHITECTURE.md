# Markimark — Architecture

## Overview

Markimark is a Tauri 2 desktop app: a minimal Rust host (window, file
associations, fs/dialog plugins) with all application logic in a Vite + React +
TypeScript frontend running in the OS-native webview (WKWebView on macOS,
WebView2 on Windows). There is no server and no network access; documents are
plain files on disk, comments live in pretty-printed sidecar JSON next to them,
and themes/settings live in the app config directory.

```

## The platform seam (SPEC FR-6, SPEC2 §3)

Every filesystem, path, dialog, window, and event access goes through the
`Platform` interface (`src/platform/types.ts`). Three implementations:

- **`tauri.ts`** — the desktop backend, macOS and Windows (plugin-fs,
  plugin-dialog, window APIs, asset protocol for local images,
  `RunEvent::Opened` + CLI-arg drain for file associations).
- **`browser.ts`** — a virtual filesystem persisted to `localStorage`, used by
  `vite dev` and the desktop-shim Playwright suite (exposed to tests as
  `window.__mmfs`). Selected only in dev mode or with `?shim=1`.
- **`web.ts`** — the static-web production platform behind the single-file
  build. Open uses `showOpenFilePicker` with an `<input type=file>` fallback;
  drag-and-drop grabs a writable handle via `getAsFileSystemHandle()` when the
  browser offers one; Save writes through the handle or, handle-less, triggers
  a download via the optional `Platform.commitFile()` hook — which only fires
  on explicit Save, so comment autosaves never spam downloads. Settings, the
  selected theme, and imported user themes (`importTheme()`) live in
  `localStorage`; documents live in memory.

App code never imports host APIs directly and never assumes an OS; hotkeys
use a "Mod" abstraction (⌘ or Ctrl).

## Windows build story

The app code was Windows-portable from v1 (this seam, `Mod` hotkeys,
`appConfigDir()`-relative paths, CLI-arg file-association handling in
`lib.rs`). Two build paths:

1. **CI (canonical)** — `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds a universal
   macOS `.dmg` on `macos-latest` and an NSIS installer on `windows-latest`
   via `tauri-action` (plus the single-file web page on `ubuntu-latest`),
   on tag push or manual dispatch.
2. **Cross-compile from macOS (experimental Tauri path)** —
   `rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, `cargo install cargo-xwin`,
   `brew install nsis llvm`, then
   `npm run tauri build -- --runner cargo-xwin --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc --bundles nsis`.
   cargo-xwin downloads the MSVC CRT/SDK; NSIS bundling runs via Homebrew's
   `makensis`. Output lands under
   `src-tauri/target/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/release/bundle/nsis/`.

`WINDOWS.md` documents the details.

## Anchor coordinate space (the key decision)

**Comment anchors are character offsets into the rendered plain text of the
document** — the concatenation of every DOM text node under the document
container, in tree order (exactly what `Range.toString()` yields). They are
*not* offsets into the markdown source.

This is the same decision as the sibling `md-with-comments` project, kept
deliberately: the sidecar schema (`exact` / 32-char `prefix`/`suffix` /
`start`/`end`) **and** the coordinate space match, so a `foo.md.comments.json`
written by either app anchors correctly in the other (verified by unit test
U8 against a real sidecar fixture from that repo). To keep the coordinate
space identical, the rendering pipeline is pinned to the same unified chain:

`remark-parse → remark-gfm → remark-rehype → rehype-sanitize (GitHub schema +
task-list checkboxes) → rehype-highlight → rehype-stringify`

`rehype-highlight` only wraps code text in `<span>`s — it never changes text
content, so it does not perturb offsets. Sanitization means documents can
never execute script.

Re-anchoring cascade on every load (`src/lib/anchoring.ts`, pure, DOM-free):

1. **Exact-at-offset** — `text.slice(start, end) === exact`.
2. **Quote search** — unique occurrence wins; among duplicates, the occurrence
   whose surroundings best match the stored prefix/suffix wins (ties → nearest
   to the stored offset).
3. **Fuzzy** — diff-match-patch `match_main`, threshold 0.4, distance 5000;
   selections longer than bitap's 32-char limit match head and tail
   independently and stitch (0.5×–2× length sanity check).
4. **Orphaned** — card kept with a badge and the original quote; no highlight;
   nothing deleted. Successful re-anchors refresh the stored anchor and
   autosave (debounced 800 ms; sidecar is deleted when the last comment goes).

## Comment storage: sidecar or embedded (SPEC2 §5)

`commentStorage` in Settings picks where comments persist:

- **Sidecar** (desktop default): `foo.md.comments.json` next to the file —
  the v1 behavior, interoperable with md-with-comments.
- **Embedded** (forced on web): an invisible trailer at the end of the file:

  ```
  <!-- markimark-comments
  {"version":1,"comments":[ …sidecar schema… ]}
  -->
  ```

  HTML comments are stripped by Markimark's sanitizer and hidden by GitHub
  and every mainstream renderer. `src/lib/embedded.ts` (pure) owns the
  format: `splitEmbedded` strips the trailer on load — it never appears in
  preview or the edit buffer — and `attachEmbedded` re-appends it on save,
  byte-preserving the content and never double-attaching.

  **The `-->` escape**: a comment body containing `-->` would close the HTML
  comment early, so serialization rewrites every `-->` in the JSON text as
  `-\u002d>` — a standard JSON string escape (`\u002d` is `-`) that
  `JSON.parse` restores losslessly. (`-->` can only occur inside JSON string
  literals, so the blanket replace is safe.)

  **Autosave semantics**: comment changes rewrite the file as *last-saved
  text + new trailer* — unsaved text edits are never flushed by a comment
  autosave; an explicit save writes buffer + trailer together.

  **Migration**: on load, comments come from the trailer if present, else the
  sidecar; if both exist they merge by id with trailer entries winning.
  Switching to embedded deletes the sidecar after the first embedded write;
  switching to sidecar strips the trailer on the next file save and writes
  the sidecar. Nothing is lost in either direction.

## Appearance settings (SPEC3 §2)

Typora-style controls, all persisted in `settings.json` (legacy `theme` key
migrates to `themeLight`):

- **Font size** — Auto uses the theme's `--mm-font-size`; Customized (10–32 px)
  sets that variable inline on the app root, which wins over any theme and
  also scales the editor (its font-size derives from the same variable).
- **Zoom** — preset percentages applied as CSS `zoom` on the app root, with
  Reset to Default. No wheel zoom by design. Selection-button placement and
  margin-card alignment divide by the zoom factor (rects are measured in
  zoomed viewport px; style offsets apply pre-zoom).
- **Light/Dark theme pair** — `themeLight` + `themeDark` selects plus "Use
  separate theme in dark mode". A live `matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme:
  dark)')` listener picks the active theme; unchecking pins the light theme
  in every scheme. **Open Theme Folder** reveals `<configDir>/themes` via
  `tauri-plugin-opener` (desktop only; the e2e shim records the call).
- **Text margins** — presets override `--mm-content-width` (narrow 60rem /
  medium 48rem / wide 38rem; Default leaves the theme's value).
- **Show line numbers** — a CodeMirror `Compartment` reconfigures the gutter
  live without recreating the editor.

## v7 (SPEC7)

- **Fixed-size settings dialog**: `.settings-modal` is a fixed box —
  `min(560px, 94vw)` × `min(480px, 85vh)` — so switching tabs never resizes
  or shifts the dialog; a tab taller than the box scrolls inside
  `.tab-content` while the rail and chrome stay put.
- **Comments master switch**: `commentsEnabled` (default on) gates every
  comment affordance — highlight injection, the margin panel, the floating
  selection button, type-to-comment, the toolbar toggle, and its hotkey.
  It is strictly non-destructive: stored comments (sidecar or trailer) are
  never rewritten by the switch; disabling only stops *rendering* them, and
  saves keep attaching the untouched comment set as before.
- **Type-to-comment**: `typeToComment` (default on). While the floating
  button is showing (non-collapsed preview selection), a printable keydown
  with no Cmd/Ctrl/Alt opens the composer seeded with that character (caret
  after it, via a focus-time `setSelectionRange`). App hotkeys and inputs
  are excluded by the same guards as elsewhere; vim-nav now ignores keys
  whenever a selection is live, so the two features can't fight.
- **Resolved ghosts, settings-owned**: the "Show resolved" switch moved from
  the panel header into Settings → General → Comments, and its default
  flipped to **on** — resolving now ghosts the card in place immediately.
  Ghosts faded from 0.55 to **0.40** opacity (highlight tint 40% → 25%), and
  resolving clears the card's active state so the brighter `.active` styling
  never masks the fade.
- **Split edit** (`splitEdit`, default off): edit mode becomes editor |
  divider | live preview instead of the full-screen swap. The right pane is
  a plain reading pane (same sanitized pipeline + asset-src resolution, no
  comment UI — reading preview stays the comments surface) re-rendered on a
  200 ms debounce. The 5 px divider drags with pointer capture, writing the
  `--mm-split` CSS variable directly during the drag (no React re-render per
  mousemove) and persisting `splitRatio` (clamped 0.2–0.8) on release;
  double-click resets to 0.5.
- **Undo history survives mode toggles**: CodeMirror's `history()` +
  `historyKeymap` already provide ⌘Z/⇧⌘Z, but the editor unmounts on every
  toggle. On unmount the editor now serializes its state
  (`EditorState.toJSON({ history: historyField })`) into an App-held ref and
  revives it on the next mount (`fromJSON` with fresh extensions), so
  undo/redo — and the caret — survive preview↔edit round-trips. Opening a
  different document resets the parked state; a buffer that moved on while
  in preview (file watcher) is converged as one undoable change.

## v6 (SPEC6)

- **Editor column alignment**: the CodeMirror scroller centers its content
  (`justify-content: center`) with the content element capped at
  `--mm-content-width` (border-box, 32px side padding) — the same geometry as
  preview's `.doc`, so toggling modes never shifts the text column. With the
  line-number gutter on, the gutter+content pair is centered, shifting text
  by at most half the gutter width.
- **Word-style comment flow**: margin cards are absolutely positioned with
  animated `top`s (180 ms). Flow margins were replaced because they can only
  push cards DOWN — the Word behavior needs the active card anchored level
  with its highlight while earlier cards stack upward above it. Idle layout
  is unchanged visually. Cards wear a faint shadow (`--mm-card-shadow`),
  deeper when active; the panel's min-height is set from the computed layout
  so scrolling still reaches everything.
- **Resolved ghosts**: "Show resolved" (panel header, persisted as
  `showResolved`, default off) renders resolved comments ghosted in place
  (55% opacity cards, faint `mark.hl.ghost` highlights) with Reopen/Delete
  live; off keeps the collapsed Resolved (N) section. Resolving never touches
  the stored comment beyond its `resolved` flag — the sidecar/trailer formats
  are unchanged.
- **Theme catalog ×27**: 20 new built-ins generated from canonical palettes —
  typographic lights (Crisp Mono, Typewriter, Manuscript, Newsprint, Sepia),
  programming classics (Solarized Dark, Gruvbox ×2, Tokyo Night, Catppuccin
  ×2, GitHub Dark, Rosé Pine, Everforest, Night Owl, Zenburn, Ayu Light), and
  terminal/quirky (Phosphor and Amber Terminal with CRT glow, Vaporwave with
  a gradient h1). U14 machine-checks the catalog: unique ids, valid metadata,
  distinct backgrounds, no rejected files.

## v5 polish (SPEC5)

- **Rename**: the product is **"Marky Mark"** everywhere users see it (window
  titles, bundle `productName` → `Marky Mark.app`, welcome doc, docs, web
  `<title>`). The bundle **identifier stays `com.markimark.app`** on purpose:
  changing it would relocate the config dir and orphan existing settings,
  themes, and the welcome doc. Internal names (npm package, crate, test ids,
  the `markimark-comments` trailer marker — a file format!) are unchanged.
- **App badge**: with no document open, the toolbar title slot shows an
  inline-SVG replica of the app icon (white M on the terracotta rounded
  square) instead of the app name.
- **Auto-hide is opt-in now** (`autoHideToolbar`, default false). Off = the
  bar is permanent and the workspace gets matching top padding
  (`.toolbar-static`); on = the SPEC4 hide/reveal behavior. Hover and focus
  pins are derived from window/document-level events (mousemove, focusin,
  mousedown) rather than enter/leave/blur pairs alone — Chromium drops those
  boundary events when the hovered/focused node (a closing menu item) is
  unmounted, which otherwise wedges the bar visible.
- The empty-state hint is absolutely centered in the window.

## v4 chrome (SPEC4)

- **Auto-hiding toolbar**: the bar is an absolutely-positioned overlay
  (`.toolbar-shell`, translateY transition, faint bottom shadow via
  `--mm-toolbar-shadow`). Visible for `TOOLBAR_GRACE_MS` (2.5 s) after launch,
  then hidden; a 20 px top hot zone reveals it on hover, and it re-hides
  `TOOLBAR_HIDE_DELAY_MS` (400 ms) after the pointer leaves. It stays pinned
  while the menu popover or any modal is open, or focus is inside the bar.
  The workspace owns the full window height, so hiding never reflows content;
  the editor's top padding clears the bar so a revealed overlay never covers
  the first line.
- **Tabbed settings**: the modal is a left tab rail (Appearance / General /
  Hotkeys) + content pane, max 70vh. Appearance = font size, zoom, theme
  pair, theme folder actions, margins; General = editor, comments,
  navigation; Hotkeys = recorders. Inactive tabs are unmounted.
- **Text-only zoom**: zoom is a `--mm-zoom` font multiplier consumed by the
  document and editor font-size calcs — CSS `zoom` (v3) scaled the whole UI
  including dialogs, so it was dropped, along with its coordinate
  compensation in comment positioning.
- **Clean start + Help**: no auto-opened welcome; an empty state shows a
  drag-a-file hint (with the user's actual open hotkey). The menu's Help item
  opens the welcome doc through the normal open path.
- **Open guard**: every user-initiated open (dialog, Help, drag-drop,
  association events) routes through one guard that shows a
  Save / Don't save / Cancel prompt when the buffer is dirty (same-path
  reopens and watcher reloads are exempt).
- **Margins**: presets super-narrow 76rem / narrow 60rem / medium 48rem /
  wide 38rem; all seven built-in themes now ship a 60rem column (Claude's
  752px Typora column was superseded by this).

## Vim-style navigation (SPEC3 §5)

Opt-in setting. `src/lib/vimnav.ts` is a pure key-sequence resolver
(`j`/`k` line scroll, `Ctrl+d`/`Ctrl+u` half viewport, `gg` top within a
500 ms pair window, `G` bottom) with pending-`g` state, unit-tested without a
DOM. The App wires it to a window keydown listener active only in preview
mode, and it stands down whenever focus is in an input/textarea/
contenteditable or any modal overlay is open — typing "j" in the comment
composer types a j.

## Save As (SPEC3 §3)

`Platform.saveFileDialog(suggestedName)` — native save dialog on Tauri,
`showSaveFilePicker`/download fallback on web, a test hook in the shim. The
App writes the buffer (plus the embedded trailer in embedded mode) to the
chosen path, writes a sidecar next to the new file in sidecar mode, then
switches the session to the new document — comments always travel.

## Theming

A theme is one `.css` file setting the `--mm-*` custom-property contract on
`.theme-root` (documented in `THEMES.md`), with `@name/@author/@variant`
metadata in its first comment block. `parseTheme()` (`src/lib/themes.ts`,
pure) handles metadata with filename fallbacks and **rejects any theme
referencing remote `url(http…)`** — the app promises zero network traffic.

The **Claude** built-in (v3) is a direct port of the user's Typora Claude
theme (`abnerworks.Typora/themes/claude.css`), with its values pinned in
SPEC3 §7: `#faf9f5` paper, `#141413` ink, terracotta `#D97757` for
caret/selection/link-hover, a **serif body** ("Anthropic Serif Web Text"
first in the stack — used when locally installed — with Georgia fallback; no
fonts are bundled since themes may not reference remote resources), a 752px
column, Typora's tight headings (h1 1.375rem / h2 1.125rem / h3 1rem, bold,
compact margins), muted-red inline code on a faint warm wash, and bottom-only
hairline table borders. Everything beyond the variable contract lives as
extra CSS scoped under `.theme-root` in the same file.

Built-in themes are ordinary theme files bundled via Vite raw imports
(`src/bundled.ts`); user themes are read from `<configDir>/themes/`, which is
created on first run along with a copy of `THEMES.md` as `README.md`.
Switching themes swaps the text of one `<style>` element — no reload. The
structural stylesheet (`src/styles.css`) consumes only the variables (with
Crisp-value fallbacks), so partial themes degrade gracefully; the CodeMirror
editor inherits the same variables, so dark themes get a dark editor for free.

## Edit mode

A full-screen swap (never side-by-side): preview unmounts, CodeMirror 6
mounts, and vice versa. The CodeMirror chunk is `React.lazy`-loaded so it
costs nothing until first use (~500 KB stays out of the startup path).
`Cmd+S` saves; a dirty dot tracks unsaved changes; window close with unsaved
changes is intercepted (Tauri `onCloseRequested` / `beforeunload`) and routed
to an in-app Save / Don't save / Cancel modal. Hotkeys are user-remappable in
Settings (captured on a recorder field, conflict-checked, persisted to
`settings.json`), matched by a window-level capture-phase listener so e.g.
Cmd+S never falls through to the webview.

## File watching and external edits

The open document is watched (plugin-fs `watch`, 400 ms debounce; a
change-listener on the virtual fs in the browser shim). External changes
reload content and re-run the cascade — unless the buffer is dirty or edit
mode is active, in which case local work is never clobbered.

## Testing

- **Vitest** (`tests/unit/`): the pure cascade (U1 exact, U2 quote-after-
  insert, U3 prefix/suffix disambiguation among 3+ duplicates, U4 fuzzy after
  in-anchor typos, U5 orphaning), theme metadata/rejection (U6, U7), and
  sidecar round-trip + md-with-comments interop fixture (U8).
- **Playwright** (`tests/e2e/app.spec.ts`): drives the real UI through the
  browser shim (E1–E16): rendering, theme picking/persistence via Settings,
  drop-in user themes, the edit/preview swap, save, hotkey remapping, the
  overflow menu, the full-path tooltip, the full comment lifecycle including
  edit-survival and orphaning via simulated on-disk edits, and both comment
  storage modes with their autosave/dirty-buffer semantics. A shared fixture
  fails any test that produces a browser console error. (`tauri-driver` does
  not support macOS, which is why e2e runs against the shim; the Tauri host
  is covered by `cargo check` in validate plus the packaged-app smoke run
  below.)
- **Playwright web suite** (`tests/e2e/web.spec.ts`, W1–W4): runs against the
  built `dist-web/index.html` served statically, with `showOpenFilePicker`
  deleted to exercise the portable fallbacks — drag-drop open, file-input
  open, download save with the embedded trailer, round-trip reopen, and a
  zero-network-requests assertion proving self-containment at runtime.
- `npm run validate` = typecheck → unit → desktop e2e → web build → web e2e →
  `cargo check` → single-file check → `VALIDATION: ALL PASSED`.

## Measured performance (Apple Silicon, this machine)

| Metric (SPEC §4 budget) | Measured |
| --- | --- |
| Cold launch of packaged .app → first-run bootstrap complete (< 1 s) | **789 ms** |
| Boot + render welcome.md, production bundle in shim | **55 ms** |
| Open + render a 5,202-line markdown file (< 300 ms) | **209 ms** |
| Theme switch applied (< 50 ms) | **38–51 ms**¹ |
| Preview ⇄ edit toggle, warm (< 100 ms) | **6–8 ms** |
| First toggle into edit (one-time lazy CodeMirror load) | ~800 ms |
| Packaged Markimark.app size (< 25 MB) | see build output (≈ 10 MB) |

¹ Measured through Playwright round-trips (click → polled computed style), so
these numbers include harness overhead; the in-page style swap itself is a
single `<style>` text assignment. Cold launch is measured from process spawn
to the app's first-run config bootstrap (which happens during first render).

## Tradeoffs

- Anchors are coupled to the renderer's text output; changing the markdown
  pipeline could shift offsets. Accepted: the quote/fuzzy steps recover, the
  pipeline is pinned, and it buys sidecar interop with md-with-comments.
- The browser shim's virtual fs lives in `localStorage` (~5 MB). Fine for
  tests and dev; the real app has no such limit.
- `bundle.targets` builds `.app` + `.dmg` only; Windows targets are a config
  change documented in `WINDOWS.md`.
